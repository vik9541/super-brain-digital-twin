## 📧 Template 1: Expert/Advisor Outreach

**Subject**: Seeking Technical Feedback on AI Contact Manager (GNN-Powered)

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out because of your expertise in [area of expertise].

I've spent the past 8 months building Super Brain Digital Twin – an AI-powered contact management platform using Graph Neural Networks. As someone with deep experience in [their area], your feedback would be invaluable.

## What It Does
Transforms contact networks into actionable insights using GraphSAGE (PyTorch Geometric):
• 95% recommendation accuracy vs 70% traditional methods
• <200ms inference on 10K node graphs
• Open source on GitHub

## Why I'm Reaching Out
Before building Phase 9, I want to ensure the architecture is sound and I'm solving a real problem. Specifically, I'd love your input on:

1. **[Area 1 specific to them]** – e.g., "GNN architecture for production deployment"
2. **[Area 2 specific to them]** – e.g., "Scaling to 1M+ users"
3. **[Area 3 specific to them]** – e.g., "Go-to-market strategy for B2B SaaS"

## What I'm Asking
Would you be open to a 20-minute call or async feedback via email? I've prepared a detailed product spec (3,000 words) for review.

No pressure at all – even a quick email with your thoughts would be incredibly helpful.

## Resources
• GitHub: github.com/vik9541/super-brain-digital-twin
• Product Spec: [Attach PDF or link]
• GNN Technical Report: [Link to PHASE8_GNN_REPORT.md]

Thank you for considering this. Your insights have been influential in my thinking (I loved your [article/talk/project]).

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. Happy to credit you in our acknowledgments if your feedback shapes the product!

## 💰 Template 2: Investor Outreach (Early Preview)

**Subject**: Early Preview: AI Contact Manager Using Graph Neural Networks

**Body**:
```
Hi [Investor Name],

I'm [Your Name], and I'm building Super Brain Digital Twin – an AI-powered relationship intelligence platform using Graph Neural Networks.

I know you invest in [thesis: AI/SaaS/B2B tools], and I wanted to share an early preview before our public launch.

## The Opportunity
$3B market for professional networking & relationship intelligence, growing 13% CAGR.

**The Problem**: 60% of professional opportunities come from your network, yet 90% of contacts remain dormant. Traditional CRMs use simple scoring – we use Graph Neural Networks.

## Traction (8 Months)
✅ Phase 8 complete (GNN implementation: 95% accuracy)
✅ 17,500 LOC production code
✅ Open source with community building
✅ Launching publicly next week

## Why We're Different
1. **Only platform using GNNs** for contact intelligence
2. **Open source** with potential for network effects
3. **Privacy-first** GDPR-compliant from day 1
4. **Competitive pricing** ($29/mo vs $349/mo for Clay)

## Next 90 Days
• Public launch (seeking 100+ feedback comments)
• Phase 9: Email sync, Slack bot, LLM integration
• Beta with 100 users
• $50k ARR target

## Ask
This is **not a fundraise** (yet) – just an early preview and feedback request.

Would you be open to:
1. **15-min call** to share your thoughts?
2. **Intro to 2-3 advisors** in CRM/AI space?
3. **Follow along** for our public launch?

## Resources
• One-pager: [Attach PDF]
• Product spec: [Link]
• GitHub: github.com/vik9541/super-brain-digital-twin
• Demo video: [Coming soon]

Thank you for your time. I respect how valuable it is.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Planning to raise seed round ($500k-$1M) in Q1 2026 after proving PMF. Would love your guidance on milestones to hit.
